# Capstone Project

## Project Idea

What is your project idea?  How did you come up with it? Why? Who would use it?

I have a project idea is an app that lets people select artists that they want to see in concert.  If I had a longer timeframe, I would work on letting users track shows they have been two and put together a wishlist of artists.  The app will then let them know when someone they like is coming into town.


## How does it work?
A user creates an account and searches for artist to add to their wishlist.  They are then able to select if they have see them.  Future state, I would like them to be able to record where they saw them using a 3rd part concert api.  They can then mark whether they have seen
this artist.


## Write between 3-5 user stories

* As a user, I want an intuitive application that is easy to navigate
* As a user, I want a system where I can search for artist
* As a user, I want to know when one of my artists in coming to visit town.

## Plan your tables and columns

What tables will you need? What will the columns on the table be?

Wishlist {
Artist_id: ,
user_id: ,
wish_status:
}



Artist {
artist_name:
}

User {
Email:
Password: ,
Name:
}

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

###Inital ERD
See ERD- Tracktour.png

###Final ERD
See Final ERD.png

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

3 routes :
1) user-auth
2) artists
3) concerts



## Timetable

Write a basic timetable for yourself, you don't have to stick to it but it
helps to go in with a plan.

* June 5 - Initial commits and Authorization
* June 6 - API and Basic Front End
* June 7 - 3rd party API (if possible)
* June 8 - 9 - Front end framework (if possible)

# rails-api-template

A template for starting projects with `rails-api`. Includes authentication.

At the beginning of each cohort, update the versions in [`Gemfile`](Gemfile).

## Dependencies

Install with `bundle install`.

-   [`rails-api`](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api)
-   [`rails`](https://github.com/rails/rails)
-   [`active_model_serializers`](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers)
-   [`ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
-   [`postgres`](http://www.postgresql.org)

Until Rails 5 is released, this template should follow the most recent released
version of Rails 4, as well as track `master` branches for `rails-api` and
`active_model_serializers`.

## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`scripts`](scripts) to test built-in actions. Add your
own scripts to test your custom API. As an alternative, you can write automated
tests in RSpec to test your API.
